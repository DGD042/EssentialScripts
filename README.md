# EssentialScripts
Essential scripts is a repository of some of the scripts that I used in all of my projects and set-up for IDE's, must of the scripts presented in this repository work as a stand alone scripts. Each folder has a README.MD file that describes the scripts located in them and what they can do. Please check the importing packages used before using any of the scripts presented

If you have any question, suggestion or some of the scripts have some problems, please create an Issue here at github or send me an email to <daniel.gonzalez@vanderbilt.edu>.
