# Python Scripts
The codes here work by stand alone scripts with methods and functions:

- utilities.py: misc codes that allow to create folders (CrFolder), show the folders available in a specific directory (GetFolders), send emails, calculate the time for a code to run, among other scripts.

- graphs.py: Script to build and save plots quickly and easy, **This code works along with utilities.py**.
